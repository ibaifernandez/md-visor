# ðŸ“š Local Markdown Viewer

Got your brain messed up with thousands of loose notes, half-cooked ideas, and scattered docs everywhere?  
Perfect. This project is for you.

A simple `.md` file viewer â€” neat, folder-organized, and **without any bloated dependencies**.  
Open it in your browser. Read. Thatâ€™s it. Why complicate?

## ðŸš€ How to Use It

### 1. Clone the freaking repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ibaifernandez/visor-md.git
cd visor-md
```

### 2. Drop your docs into `/docs`

Organize your Markdown files however you want:

```plaintext
docs/
â”œâ”€â”€ project-1/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ intro.md
â”œâ”€â”€ ideas/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ manifesto.md
â””â”€â”€ stuff-that-doesnt-fit-anywhere/
    â””â”€â”€ random.md
```

### 3. Generate the file list

Every time you add new files, run:

```bash
node generateFileList.js
```

Yeah, manually. Like the keyboard gods intended.  
(No automation. No black magic. It's JavaScript, not Hogwarts.)

### 4. Run a local server

If you donâ€™t have `http-server` installed:

```bash
npm install -g http-server
```

Then run:

```bash
http-server .
```

Open your browser where the terminal tells you.  
Boom.

### âœ¨ What It Does

- Displays your Markdown docs â€” no fuss.
- Auto-organizes them into folders with accordions.
- Uses `marked.js` to render beautifully.
- Includes a disclaimer you can dismiss (because nagging is optional).
- Ugly if you want, pretty if you tweak it. Your call.

## ðŸ“Ž Loose Notes

This project doesnâ€™t store changes.  
Thereâ€™s no backend.  
And itâ€™s *definitely* not trying to be Notion.

Itâ€™s like an old notebookâ€¦ just sharper on a retina screen.

If you break it, well â€” thatâ€™s on you.

## ðŸ§  Philosophy

Because not everything needs to be SaaS, freemium, or cost your digital soul.  
Because `.md` files deserve love too.  
Because youâ€™re worth it. Or at least your notes are.

## ðŸ†“ License

MIT. Do whatever you want with it.  
No need to credit me.  
Just donâ€™t pretend you built it from scratch. That would be lame.
