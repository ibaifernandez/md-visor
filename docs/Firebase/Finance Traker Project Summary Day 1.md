# Project Summary: Firebase Studio App Development - July 17th 2025

## Overall Progress

Today's session focused on establishing the foundational user authentication flow for the Firebase Studio App.

This is just a cache test.

Me and "my partner in crime" — Firebase AI — successfully implemented a beta whitelist using a Firebase Authentication blocking function, built the core signup and email verification pages in the Next.js frontend, set up global authentication state management with React Context and the `AuthProvider`, and deployed the application to Firebase App Hosting—among many other tasks that allowed us to achieved these
aforementioned goals.

## Phase 1: Implementing Beta Whitelist with a Blocking Function

**Goal:** Restrict user signups to users with emails listed in a Firestore collection (`betaList`).

**Approach:** Utilize a Firebase Authentication `beforeCreate` [blocking function](https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions/blocking-functions) to intercept new user creations and check their email against the whitelist before the user is fully provisioned.

**Implementation Steps:**

1. **Developed the Cloud Function:** Wrote the code for the `beforeCreate` function (`/functions/src/index.ts`) that:
    * Is triggered by `auth.user().beforeCreate`.
    * Extracts the user's email from the event object.
    * Queries the `betaList` collection in Firestore to check for a document with the user's email as the document ID.
    * If the email is not found in `betaList`, throws a `functions.auth.HttpsError('permission-denied', 'Tu email no se encuentra en la lista de acceso beta.')` to block the signup.
    * If the email is found, allows the signup to proceed by simply exiting the function.

2. **Addressed Linting and TypeScript Errors:** Encountered and resolved several issues during development and building of the functions:
    * **`max-len` linting errors:** Resolved by breaking long lines in `/functions/src/index.ts`.
    * **Unused Imports:** Removed unnecessary imports (`onRequest`, `logger`, `hasClaim`) from `/functions/src/index.ts` and `/functions/src/genkit-sample.ts`.
    * **TypeScript Error: `Property 'auth' does not exist on type 'EventContext<BeforeCreate>'`:** This indicated a mismatch between the Firebase Functions v1 syntax being used and the v2 types.
        * **Resolution:** Updated Firebase dependencies (`firebase-functions`, `firebase-admin`).
        * **Resolution:** Switched to Node.js version 22 using `fnm use 22`.
        * **Resolution:** Reinstalled functions dependencies (`npm install` or `yarn install`) within the `/functions` directory with Node.js 22 active.
        * **Resolution:** Rewrote the trigger using the correct Firebase Functions v2 syntax (`onBeforeUserCreated({ region: 'us-central1' }, async (event) => { ... })`) and imported `HttpsError` from `firebase-functions/v2/https`.
    * **Implicit `any` Type Errors:** Explicitly typed variables (e.g., `email`) and function parameters where types were not clearly inferred.

3. **Deployed Cloud Functions:** Successfully deployed the updated functions using the command `firebase deploy --only functions`. Confirmed the deployment and addressed the Artifact Registry cleanup policy.

4. **Configured Blocking Function:** Set the deployed `checkBetaWhitelist` function as the `beforeCreate` blocking function in the Firebase console under Authentication -> Settings -> Blocking Functions.

## Phase 2: Building the Signup and Email Verification Flow (Next.js)

**Goal:** Create the frontend pages and logic for user signup, guiding users to verify their email, and handling the email verification process.

**Implementation Steps:**

1. **Created Signup Page (`/src/app/signup/page.tsx`):**
    * Built a basic form for email and password input.
    * Implemented form submission logic using `createUserWithEmailAndPassword` from the Firebase Auth SDK.
    * Added error handling, specifically checking for the `"functions/permission-denied"` error code from the blocking function and displaying a user-friendly message.
    * Added the `sendEmailVerification` call after successful user creation.
    * Used `useRouter` from `next/navigation` to redirect the user after signup.

2. **Created Check Email Page (`/src/app/check-email/page.tsx`):**
    * A simple page to instruct the user to check their email inbox for the verification link.
    * Integrated redirection logic to navigate the user here after a successful signup.

3. **Created Verify Email Page (`/src/app/verify-email/page.tsx`):**
    * Used `useSearchParams` from `next/navigation` to extract the `oobCode` from the URL parameters (which Firebase adds to the verification link).
    * Used `applyActionCode` from the Firebase Auth SDK with the `oobCode` to complete the email verification process.
    * Added state to display messages indicating the verification status.
    * Used `useRouter` to redirect the user to a welcome page upon successful verification.
    * **Resolved TypeScript Error: `Cannot find name 'router'`:** Imported and initialized the `useRouter` hook within the component.
    * **Resolved Next.js Build Error: `useSearchParams() should be wrapped in a suspense boundary`:** Wrapped the component logic that uses `useSearchParams` within a `<Suspense>` boundary in `/src/app/verify-email/page.tsx`.

4. **Created Welcome Page (`/src/app/welcome/page.tsx`):** A simple placeholder page to serve as the destination after successful email verification.

## Phase 3: Setting Up Global Authentication State

**Goal:** Provide a consistent way for any component in the application to access the current user's authentication status.

**Approach:** Utilize React Context to create an `AuthProvider` that wraps the application's content.

**Implementation Steps:**

1. **Created Auth Context (`/src/context/AuthContext.tsx`):**
    * Defined a React Context using `createContext` to hold the `user` object (`User | null`) and a `loading` boolean.

2. **Implemented Auth Provider (`/src/context/AuthContext.tsx`):**
    * Created the `AuthProvider` React component.
    * Used `onAuthStateChanged` from Firebase Auth to listen for real-time changes in the authentication state.
    * Managed the `user` and `loading` states using `useState` and updated them within the `onAuthStateChanged` listener.
    * Provided the `user` and `loading` values to the context consumers using `AuthContext.Provider`.
    * Included a cleanup function in the `useEffect` to unsubscribe from the listener when the component unmounts.

3. **Created `useAuth` Hook (`/src/context/AuthContext.tsx`):** A custom hook to simplify accessing the `AuthContext` value in other components.

4. **Wrapped Application Content in Layout (`/src/app/layout.tsx`):**
    * Imported the `AuthProvider` into the root layout component.
    * Wrapped the `{children}` prop (representing the page content) with `<AuthProvider>`.
    * **Resolved Hydration Error: `In HTML, whitespace text nodes cannot be a child of <head>`:** Addressed this by removing all whitespace between HTML tags within the `<head>` section of `/src/app/layout.tsx`.

5. **Demonstrated Authentication State Usage (`/src/app/page.tsx`):**
    * Imported and used the `useAuth` hook in the root page component.
    * Implemented conditional rendering to display different content based on the `user` and `loading` state (showing signup/login links for unauthenticated users and a welcome message/settings link for authenticated users).
    * Clarified the use of `{' '}` in JSX for rendering explicit spaces between elements.

## Phase 4: Deploying the Next.js App to Firebase App Hosting

**Goal:** Make the Next.js application publicly accessible.

**Approach:** Deploy the built application to Firebase App Hosting.

**Implementation Steps:**

1. **Built the Next.js Application:** Successfully ran `npm run build` (after resolving the `useSearchParams` Suspense error).

2. **Identified Deployment Target:** Noted that the `firebase.json` was configured for `apphosting` with `backendId: "tracker-app"`, not traditional `hosting`.

3. **Addressed Duplicate Backend:** Observed the presence of two App Hosting backends ("tracker-app" and "Studio") in the Firebase console. Successfully deleted the unnecessary "Studio" backend.

4. **Deployed to App Hosting:** Executed the correct deployment command `firebase deploy --only apphosting:tracker-app`.

5. **Obtained Hosting URL:** The Firebase CLI provided the public URL for the deployed application upon successful deployment.

6. **Configured Email Verification Action URL:** Updated the "Action URL" in the Firebase console (Authentication -> Templates -> Email address verification) to point to the deployed application's `/verify-email` route (e.g., `https://your-app-url.com/verify-email`). This ensures that verification links in emails redirect users back to your application.

## Conclusion

Today's efforts have established the core user authentication system, including the beta whitelist, signup, email verification, and global state management. The application is now successfully deployed and the email verification flow correctly directs users back to the application. The next steps will involve building out the login page, settings functionality, and other application features.
